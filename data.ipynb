    "- **Focus on Relevant Areas:** By cropping, you ensure that the model processes only the most relevant portions of the image, which can improve training efficiency.\n",
    "- **Memory and Computation:** 3D medical images are large and require significant computational resources. Cropping reduces the size of the data, making it more manageable for GPU memory and speeding up training.\n",
    "- **Patch Size Compatibility:** Many deep learning architectures, especially those dealing with 3D data, require input sizes divisible by a specific number (like 64 in this code). Cropping ensures the volume fits this requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawbacks of Cropping:**\n",
    "- **Risk of Losing Important Information:** If the cropping is too aggressive or poorly designed, important parts of the image (like a tumor) could be excluded, which could negatively impact the model's performance.\n",
    "- **Assumption of Consistency:** Cropping assumes that the region of interest (ROI) is consistently located within the same region across all images. This might not hold true for all patients or images, potentially leading to information loss.\n"
